Mario Pardo COMP3005

This is my submission for COMP3005 A3 Q1

To run the code, simply open the project (I used intellij), and it should simply run

TO CONNECT DATABASE

Create a SQL databse (I used pgAdmin4) and use the scripts inside of "SQL_Code"
to create the database and then add data

Then in the top of the main function in the java code, you must update the
required database name, username, and password, so that it can connect to it.
This is device specific.

Once this is done, the program should run no problem.
